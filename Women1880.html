			<p>Women were becoming more and more interested in earning a
				proper education in order to establish themselves in the labour
				force. In 1881, there was a 75.6% rise in girls attending school
				compared to 1842. Women were beginning to enter the workforce, but
				only in “female professions”, which consisted of jobs like teaching
				– the first of the woman-centric professions.</p>

				Rights - A Glimmer
			</h3>

			<p>
				It was during this decade and the next that women began to receive
				municipal voting rights. It was only granted to those who
				were spinsters or widowers in Ontario in 1884. Voting was deemed to be a privilege, not a right and
				women were dismissed when they tried to bring up the issue of voting
				as they were seen as too emotional to handle politics.
