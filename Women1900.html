			</h3>

			<p>The Dominion Elections Act was put into place and this meant
				that only those who could already vote in provincial elections would
				be allowed to vote federally. Of course, this ruled women and other
				minorities out. Most of the women in Canada that own property are
				able to vote in their municipal elections at this time.</p>
			<p>Backlash is building against women seeking the vote. More
				bills are introduced in Ontario as well as in New Brunswick but the
				women are laughed at, insulted and treated with hostility. In
				Manitoba, the sergeant-at-arms, who is meant to keep order during
				meetings, was instructed to repeatedly ring the division bells until
				the women had left the building.</p>
			<p>Women in Canada relied heavily on petitions to lobby for the
				provincial vote. Some of said petitions would have over 100 000
				names on it.</p>
			
			<p>
				<br>These families had to start with nothing - not even shelter
				or readily available water. Women worked alongside their husbands
				and children to build a home, start a farm, and dig wells. Women
				were a key part of the homestead life and as such they got their
				hands dirty. They spun their own yarn and sewed clothing for the
				family, tended to the livestock and handled gardening. They did this
				all far away from their family and friends. They were often far from
				medical help as well, so injuries often resulted in death.

				Property and Patriarchy
			</h3>

			<p>In 1872, women in Ontario were given the right to earn their
				own wage without it being in the control of their husband. This was
				given to them by the Married Women's Property Act of Ontario. It was
				one of the first times that women were given such a right.
			<p>First Nations women were not seeing such positive change. The
				Indian Act of 1876 stripped native women of their Indian status and
				right to live on reserves if they decided to marry a non-native.
				This meant that if their husband died or abandoned them, they could
				not return to their reserve as they were essentially evicted. They
				were denied education and health care and they couldn't even inherit
				land from family that was still on the reserve. This didn't apply to
				native men, who could marry whoever they wanted without it resulting
				in loss of property or their title.</p>

					aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><br>Women's
				Associations
			</h3>
			<p>Women began to form groups in order to discuss issues
				pertaining to their rights. One of these early organizations,
				Toronto Women's Literary Guild (later renamed Canadian Women's
				Suffrage Association) was founded by Emily Stowe, among others.
				Stowe was the first woman to practice medicine in Canada. She did so
				without having an official license, because women were not welcome
				in Canadian colleges and universities. She had to study in the
				United States to get a degree. The Toronto Women's Literary Guild
				worked hard as the first suffragette group in Canada to push for
				higher education for Women.</p>
