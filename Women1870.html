			</h3>

			<p>Beginning around 1870 (and continuing on into 1914) many
				Canadian women got married and then moved across Canada to take
				advantage of the Dominion Lands Policy. Land was almost free and
				many families jumped at the opportunity to build their lives on this
				land. They headed to the Prairies in droves and arrived to find that
				succeeding was surviving.</p>

			</div>
			<p>These families had to start with nothing - not even shelter or
				readily available water. Women worked alongside their husbands and
				children to build a home, start a farm, and dig wells. Women were a
				key part of the homestead life and as such they got their hands
				dirty. They spun their own yarn and sewed clothing for the family,
				tended to the livestock and handled gardening. They did this all far
				away from their family and friends. They were often far from medical
				help as well, so injuries often resulted in death.</p>

				<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"
					aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Owning
				Property and Patriarchy
			</h3>

			<p>In 1872, women in Ontario were given the right to earn their
				own wage without it being in the control of their husband. This was
				given to them by the Married Women's Property Act of Ontario. It was
				one of the first times that women were given such a right.
			<p>First Nations women were not seeing such positive change. The
				Indian Act of 1876 stripped native women of their Indian status and
				right to live on reserves if they decided to marry a non-native.
				This meant that if their husband died or abandoned them, they could
				not return to their reserve as they were essentially evicted. They
				were denied education and health care and they couldn't even inherit
				land from family that was still on the reserve. This didn't apply to
				native men, who could marry whoever they wanted without it resulting
				in loss of property or their title.</p>

			<h3>
				<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact"
					aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Women's
				Associations
			</h3>
			<p>Women began to form groups in order to discuss issues
				pertaining to their rights. One of these early organizations,
				Toronto Women's Literary Guild (later renamed Canadian Women's
				Suffrage Association) was founded by Emily Stowe, among others.
				Stowe was the first woman to practice medicine in Canada. She did so
				without having an official license, because women were not welcome
				in Canadian colleges and universities. She had to study in the
				United States to get a degree. The Toronto Women's Literary Guild
				worked hard as the first suffragette group in Canada to push for
				higher education for Women.</p>
