			</h3>

			<p>The purpose of this website is to propose a new museum exhibit
				and allow visitors to see what kind of content the exhibit would
				consist of.</p>
			<p>The rights of women in Canada went through major reform
				beginning in 1878 and continuing into the present day. Canadian
				women began their journey to equality with very little rights. They
				were not even regarded as “persons” under Canadian law. They were
				unable to own property, vote, pursue a higher education or have a
				say over their own reproductive organs.</p>

				Wave Feminism
			</h3>

			<p>
				The first wave of feminism in Canada is one of great importance.
				Navigation through each decade of the lives of Canadian women and
				the early struggles to be seen as equals would be a valuable and
				enriching learning experience. <br>
			<p>The framework of this museum exhibit is intended to be a
				decade-by-decade walkthrough of the average woman’s life in a highly
				visual and interactive environment. Each section of the exhibit
				would be an inside look – detailing the strict limitations and
				frustrations of Canadian women on a daily basis. The exhibit is mean
				to make visitors familiar with the pressures placed upon women of
				the past and to generate interest about the women who stepped up to
				demand change.</p>
			<p>
				I The influence of women in the late 1800s to early 1900s resulted
				in enormous changes for human rights in Canada. This resulted in the
				empowerment of many women and led to further movements in the 1960s
				and onwards. The Famous Five, a well-known group of brave and
				relentless women were at the forefront of the movements. They will
				be a feature of the exhibit, and as such, have their own section on
				this webpage. <br> To begin exploring the topics that are to be
				covered in the exhibit, please use the navigation menu on the left.
