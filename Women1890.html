			</h3>

			<p>Birth control was nowhere near realization in 1890. In fact, a
				federal law was put in place that made it illegal to sell or
				advertise birth control to anyone in Canada. Birth control was
				viewed as immoral and could result in a woman being sent to jail for
				up to two years if they attempted to educate each other. (cpha.ca)
				This was devastating to many women who were unable to avoid having
				more children, and would end up with yearly pregnancies that put
				their health at risk and made families poor.</p>

				Council of Women of Canada
			</h3>

			<p>In 1983 the National Council of Women of Canada was founded.
				Among the founders were Dr. Augusta Stowe-Gullen, the first woman to
				obtain a medical degree, as well as Henrietta Muir Edwards, one of
				the Famous Five. The National Council of Women of Canada was a
				contributor to the Act to Confer the Electoral Franchise Upon Women
				(which didn’t occur until 1918). The council was formed in the
				Horticultural Pavilion in Allan Gardes, Toronto with 1500 women in
				attendance. The desire to be able to vote was beginning to gain
				significant steam.</p>
			<p>During this time many bills were being introduced to get women
				the vote in Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec. They were all
				defeated.</p>

				Associations
			</h3>
			<p>Women began to form groups in order to discuss issues
				pertaining to their rights. One of these early organizations,
				Toronto Women's Literary Guild (later renamed Canadian Women's
				Suffrage Association) was founded by Emily Stowe, among others.
				Stowe was the first woman to practice medicine in Canada. She did so
				without having an official license, because women were not welcome
				in Canadian colleges and universities. She had to study in the
				United States to get a degree. The Toronto Women's Literary Guild
				worked hard as the first suffragette group in Canada to push for
				higher education for Women.</p>

				Order of Nurses
			</h3>
			<p>In 1897 the Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) was found with the
				help of Henrietta Edwards. The VON believed there was a desperate
				need for women to take up a career in nursing in order to bring
				health care to those who lived in remote areas. They had heard many
				stories of husbands whose wives had died in childbirth because they
				couldn’t reach help in time. The VON established what was called
				“cottage hospitals” in these remote areas in order to bring health
				care to those in need.</p>
